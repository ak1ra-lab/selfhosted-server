## General Development Guidelines

### Code Quality & Architecture

- Follow established style guides and conventions
- Write small, modular, well-named components
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over premature optimization
- Prefer reusable modules and functions; avoid global state

### Documentation & Communication

- Document all public APIs thoroughly
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Write all code and comments in English only (no exceptions)

### Reliability & Testing

- Validate all inputs and handle errors explicitly
- Ensure code is testable and include appropriate tests
- Maintain reproducibility across environments
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain the "why"

### Development Practices

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use consistent formatting and patterns throughout the codebase
- Consider performance implications without over-optimizing
- Review and refactor code regularly for clarity and efficiency
