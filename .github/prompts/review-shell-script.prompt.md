Review this shell script according to established guidelines, following the style of [template.sh](../template.sh). Pay attention to adjusting the order of arguments in usage and parse_args; fixed arguments (--help, --log-level, --log-format) in [template.sh](../template.sh) should come first, followed by script arguments.
